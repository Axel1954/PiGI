# PiGI - A Raspberry Pi Geiger-Mueller Interface

Built as a drop-in module for the Raspberry Pi but is designed in such a universal/versatile way, so that it's very hackable and can be connected to any processing system that can detect falling edges like:

  * Arduino
  * ATMega
  * PIC
  * Other embedded Linux ARM/MIPS systems with GPIO Inputs (GNUBLIN, Netus G20 etc.)

## Specifications

  * 40x43mm board
  * Very low energy consumption (<2mA @ 0.09uSv/h local dose rate)
  * Cathode counting
  * Low BOM count / small footprint
  * Very cheap design (Prototype costs per board: EUR15)
  * Dual stackable for low/high dosis couting with 2 tubes
  * Open-Source Hardware/Software
